# xmenu
As a [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) fan, I was dismayed when I couldn't find a clone for OSX, so I made one. UI stuff isn't my strong suit, but contributions are welcome!

xmenu is not a full clone of dmenu as it is missing vertical list support, but otherwise it should work fine.

## Building
Just run `make`. The only dependency is having XCode installed. The xmenu binary is completely standalone.

## Usage
See `xmenu -h`.
